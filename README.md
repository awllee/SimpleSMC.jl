# SimpleSMC.jl

This package provides an implementation of a simple, single-threaded SMC algorithm.

It is not registered: its main purpose is to be extended in methodological research.

It implements a subset of the features of [SequentialMonteCarlo.jl](https://github.com/awllee/SequentialMonteCarlo.jl)
